Turnkey Linux Factory for the Outscale Cloud
============================================

Slave appliance
---------------

This package is part of a factory that generates
[Turnkey Linux](http://turnkeylinux.org) appliance images for the
[Outscale](http://www.outscale.com) cloud. Since the Outscale cloud
provides an EC2-compatible API, it should be fairly portable.

This package is based on the TKL `tkldev` appliance.

See the
[outscale-factory-master](http://github.com/nodalink/outscale-factory-master)
package documentation for further details.
